# HCC2-Final-Project

There are 3 parts in this project:
(1)Merge CSV files: Users can select the CSV files they want to merge and then name the ready to export data files(XXX.csv). The resulting CSV file's column name is the name of the single CSV files. For my testing purposes, I selected 20 single-column data files from the folder "Data Files", then resulted in the exported.csv file.
(2)Data analysis: Users can select a CSV file with data in two populations. Then select the columns as two samples. Then run a paired-t test or independent t test. The GUI will render the t score and p value, also shows the user whether the result is significant. I tested it with the "BVP_Variance.csv" and "Temp_Variance.csv"
(3)Graph data: Users can select a CSV file and the program will show user the graph of the data. I tested it with the "BVP Variance.csv" and "Temp_Variance.csv"
